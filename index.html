    <h1>Debate Club Cats Vs Dogs</h1>
    <h2>Why cats are better than dogs</h2>
    <p>The reasons why cats are better than dogs are because they are easier to take care of. For example you can
        leave food out all day and they will eat when they are hungry and they will go to the litter box instead of needing to go outside. 
        Another reason why cats are better than dogs is that they are quieter and more chill. For example you can have them in places like an
        apartment building where you wouldnt be able to own a dog.
